Fourier Unit Root Tests for Structural Breaks
A Streamlit application that provides a comprehensive suite for Fourier‐based unit root testing in time series.

Theory & Introduction: Covers the mathematical foundation of Fourier series in structural‐break detection.

Comparative Framework: Contrasts traditional dummy‐variable approaches with Fourier methods.

Interactive Simulations: Lets you generate and visualize sample paths under various break scenarios (single vs. cumulative frequencies, smooth vs. sharp breaks) and compare ADF test outcomes.

Practical Guidance: Offers recommendations on test selection, frequency choice, and sample‐size considerations.
